**Hi, I'm Elvis**

I am passionate about building things and helping people and organisations succeed; I do this by
coding applications till they work and by sharing my knowledge through my articles and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYqjL8Ck19NNsVwpLQGngLA) channel;
You can check them out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@elvis.onobo) and [Hashnode](https://elvisonobo.hashnode.dev)

I built applications like [Ofrinbox](https://ofrinbox.com),
[TitleCaser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/title-caser) and [Easy Paystack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-paystack)
to make certain task fast and simple for myself and other developers.

I believe in teaching as a way of learning and advancing the world because I believe that the world
can only be as good as the minds of the people in it.
