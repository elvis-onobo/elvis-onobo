### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's that seafarer turned software developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on @easy-paystack, React-Starter-Pack, and Vue-Starter-Pack.

Absolutely know nothing about them but it's about building something that servers the community well.

That being said, here's [Title-caser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/title-caser) to help you capitalise the first word in every string.
Comes in handy in formatting user submitted strings.

I totally believe that while doing things for the greater good you end up doing things that you never thought you could.
