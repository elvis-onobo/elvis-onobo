### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's that seafarer turned software developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m have built [Easy Paystack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-paystack), a Paystack package to make the use of Paystack in
  production apps easy and [Title-Caser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/title-caser) to help fellow devs capitalise the first word in every
  string (best suited for use with user submitted data).

I am also building a React-Starter-Pack and Vue-Starter-Pack to make the basic scaffolding for frontend apps a lot faster.

In trying to build resources for the greater good, I have ended up doing things that I never thought you could.

A wise man once said, **To Teach is to Learn Twice.**

I'm on [Twitter](twitter.com/elvis-onobo)
